# Hourly Calendar 

## Project status
The site is not yet complete.

## Description
This hourly calendar is a daily scheduler that schedules by the hour in a workday, and lets the user know the current hour, as well as what hours have passed and how many hours are left in the day.


## Badges
N/A

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
No additional requirements. 

## Usage
Users can type their to-do list by the hour by typing in the input boxes next to the hour tasks should be started by. Users can save their chart by clicking the "save" button on the bottom right so their schedule is not lost.
